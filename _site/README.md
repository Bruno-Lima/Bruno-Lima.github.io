My personal webpage is published using [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) on Github pages, and the layout is based on the [Minimal Mistakes](http://mademistakes.com/) theme.
It can be viewed at Bruno-Lima.github.io

Some differences from the Minimal Mistakes theme:

* there are separate categories for blog posts and scientific publications;
* new icons (skype, message, etc)
