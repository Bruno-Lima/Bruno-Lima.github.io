### AAL4ALL

Developed societies are currently facing severe demographic changes: the world is getting older at an unprecedented rate. In 2000, about 420 million people, or approximately 7 percent of the world’s population, were aged 65 or older.<br/>
By 2050, that number will be nearly 1.5 billion people, about 16 percent of the world’s population. This demographic trend will be also followed by an increase of people with physical limitations.
New challenges will be raised to the traditional systems of health care, not only in Portugal, but also in all other European states. There is an urgent need to find solutions that allow to extend the time people can live in their preferred environment by increasing their autonomy, self-confidence and mobility.<br/>
AAL4ALL presents an idea for an answer through the development of an ecosystem of products and services for Ambient Assisted Living (AAL) associated to a business model and validated through large scale trial.<br/>
