### Abstract

In a growing number of domains, the provisioning of end-to-end services to the users depends on the proper interoperation of multiple systems, forming a new distributed system, often subject to timing constraints. To ensure interoperability and integrity, it is important to conduct integration tests that verify the interactions with the environment and between the system components in key scenarios. To tackle test automation challenges, we propose algorithms for decentralized conformance checking and test input generation, and for checking and enforcing the conditions (local observability and controllability) that allow decentralized test execution.
