### Abstract

ndustrial  cyber-physical  systems  are  becoming  in-creasingly  popular  and  starting  to  emerge  as  a  response  tosociety’s  problems  using  the  Internet  of  Things  to  create  real-time  solutions  capable  of  analyzing  large  amounts  of  data.  Inthis  article,  taking  advantage  of  this  type  of  technology,  wepresent  a  patient  prioritization  system  for  hospital  emergencyservices.  Our  system  responds  to  the  problems  that  occur  inhospitals  when  there  is  a  peak  in  the  number  of  people  usingthe  emergency  service,  increasing  the  waiting  times.  In  such  asituation,  the  clinical  condition  of  waiting  patients  may  changeafter the initial triage, requiring immediate care or at least theirre-prioritization. The proposed system consists of a combinationof a Smart Priority Recommendation and Patient Control Systemand an Hospital Emergency Smart Band placed in each patient,allowing  to  detect  changes  in  the  vital  signs  of  waiting  patientsthat  may  indicate  that  they  need  immediate  care.  This  systemnot only improves the quality of emergency services by ensuringa  more  efficient  prioritization  of  patients,  but  in  extreme  casescan help save human lives.
