### Abstract

The Internet of Things (IoT) is expected to bring forward new promising solutions in various domains. Consequently, it can impact
many aspects of everyday life, and errors can have serious
consequences. Despite this, there is a lack of standard testing processes and methods, which poses a major challenge for IoT testing. Nonetheless, closer examination makes it possible to identify a set of recurring behaviors of IoT applications and a set of corresponding test strategies.
This paper formalizes the notion of a Pattern-Based IoT Testing method for systematizing and automating the testing of IoT ecosystems. It consists in a set of test strategies for recurring behaviors of the IoT system, which can be defined as IoT Test Patterns.
