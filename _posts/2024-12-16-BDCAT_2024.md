### Abstract

As sports analytics evolve to include a broad spectrum of data from diverse sources, the challenge of integrating heterogeneous data becomes pronounced. Current methods struggle with flexibility and rapid adaptation to new data formats, risking data integrity and accuracy. This paper introduces PlayField, a framework designed to robustly handle diverse sports data through adaptable configuration and an automated API. PlayField ensures precise data integration and supports manual interventions for data integrity, making it essential for accurate and comprehensive sports analysis. A case study with ZeroZero demonstrates the framework's capability to improve data integration efficiency significantly, showcasing its potential for advanced analytics in sports.
