### Abstract

As computer science and engineering programs continue to grow in enrollment, automatic assessment tools have become prevalent. Manual assessment of programming exercises can be time-consuming and resource- intensive, creating a need for such tools. In response, this paper proposes a tool to assess assembly exercises, specifically ARM64 programs, and provide real-time feedback to students. The tool includes features for evaluating, analyzing, and detecting plagiarism in student submissions. After two years of intensive usage in a higher education environment, the results and analysis show a positive impact and potential benefits for teachers and students. Furthermore, the tool’s source code is publicly available, making it a valuable contribution to building more effective and efficient automatic assessment tools for computer science and engineering schools
