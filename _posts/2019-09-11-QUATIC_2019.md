### Abstract

To ensure interoperability and the correct end-to-end behavior of heterogenous distributed systems, it is important to conduct integration tests that verify the interactions with the environment and between the system components in key scenarios. The automation of such integration tests requires that test components are also distributed, with local testers deployed close to the system components, coordinated by a central tester. In such a test architecture, it is important to maximize the autonomy of the local testers to minimize the communication overhead and maximize the fault detection capability. A test scenario is called locally observable and locally controllable, if conformance errors can be detected locally and test inputs can be decided locally, respectively, by the local testers, without the need for exchanging coordination messages between the test components during test execution (i.e., without any communication overhead). For test scenarios specified by means of UML sequence diagrams that don’t exhibit those properties, we present in this paper an approach with tool support to automatically find coordination messages that, added to the given scenario, make it locally controllable and locally observable.
