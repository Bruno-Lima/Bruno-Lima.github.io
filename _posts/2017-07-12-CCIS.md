### Abstract

Distributed and heterogeneous systems (DHS), running over interconnected mobile and cloud-based platforms, are used in a growing number of domains for provisioning end-to-end services to users. Testing DHS is particularly important and challenging, with little support being provided by current tools. In order to assess the current state of the practice regarding the testing of DHS and identify opportunities and priorities for research and innovation initiatives, we conducted an exploratory survey that was responded by 147 software testing professionals that attended industry-oriented software testing conferences. The survey allowed us to assess the relevance of DHS in software testing practice, the most important features to be tested in DHS, the current status of test automation and tool sourcing for testing DHS, and the most desired features in test automation solutions for DHS. Some follow up interviews allowed us to further investigate drivers and barriers for DHS test automation. We expect that the results presented in the paper are of interest to researchers, tool vendors and service providers in this field.
