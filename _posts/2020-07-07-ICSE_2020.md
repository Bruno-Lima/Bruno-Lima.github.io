### Abstract

To ensure interoperability and the correct behavior of heteroge- neous distributed systems in key scenarios, it is important to con- duct automated integration tests, based on distributed test compo- nents (called local testers) that are deployed close to the system components to simulate inputs from the environment and monitor the interactions with the environment and other system compo- nents. We say that a distributed test scenario is locally controllable and locally observable if test inputs can be decided locally and conformance errors can be detected locally by the local testers, without the need for exchanging coordination messages between the test components during test execution (which may reduce the responsiveness and fault detection capability of the test harness). DCO Analyzer is the first tool that checks if distributed test sce- narios specified by means of UML sequence diagrams exhibit those properties, and automatically determines a minimum number of coordination messages to enforce them.
