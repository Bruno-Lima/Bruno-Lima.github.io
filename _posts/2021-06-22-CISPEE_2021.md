### Abstract

The 2020/2021 academic year started full of uncertainties for new students of higher education in Portugal. The restrictions imposed by the COVID-19 pandemic, the fears of a new lockdown, all coupled with the well-known challenges that a university student faces in his first year, made this year a particularly challenging year in terms of the students' integration. In this paper, we present how the mentoring programme of the Integrated Master in Informatics and Computing Engineering at the Faculty of Engineering of the University of Porto was adapted to help the integration of first-year students in the university environment under the pandemic.
