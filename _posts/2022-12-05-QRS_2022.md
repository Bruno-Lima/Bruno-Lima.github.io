### Abstract

One of the most critical ICT application domains is healthcare, where a single failure can lead a patient into a hazardous situation. Due to this, there's a great necessity to ensure that the developed solutions are safe and secure and perform as expected. Smart-Health-4-All (SH4ALL) is a project aiming at accelerating the research, development, commercialization, and dissemination of trustworthy smart health solutions in Portugal. One of the key components of the project is a web platform that supports the generation of integration and system tests for smart health solutions (comprising medical devices, applications, etc.), following a software product line approach. At the domain engineering level, the platform supports the creation of feature models and related test patterns for families of smart health products. At the product engineering level, the platform supports the instantiation of test patterns and the generation of corresponding test scripts ready for execution on specific products under test. This paper presents the aforementioned test platform and test process, and the discovery of test patterns.
